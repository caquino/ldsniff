ll that u have to know

this will not work with static binaries...
so... netcat and other things are safe (safe?)

any file descriptor above 2 will be logged. pay attention with your disk space.

why above 2 ?
0 = stdin
1 = stdout
2 = stderr

if u want to log all these 3 fd , change the code.

BSD Flavored?
make USE_BSD=1

optlib.c:
#define LOG "/tmp/optlib.log" -> snif log

u can use ld.so.preload too... but.. it's your own risk.
